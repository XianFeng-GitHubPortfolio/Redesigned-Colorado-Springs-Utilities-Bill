Colorado Springs Utilities was facing the issue whereby the residents of Colorado Springs was simultaneously creating a surge in energy demands at specific times during the day. 
These peak energy deamnds were only met by utilizing the coal powered Martin Drake Power Plant in downtown Colorado Springs. Not only was this was cost ineffective,
which ultimately hurt their bottom line, the plant also created significant air pollution, right in the heart of Colorado Springs. 

With only four weeks time, my team and I were tasked with tackling this challenge.  Through the use of behavioral economics via data visualization and small-scale A/B testing, 
we successfully developed and presented an innovative and implementable solution for Colorado Springs Utilities in the form of a redesigned energy bill.
